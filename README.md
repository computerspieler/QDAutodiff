# QDAutodiff
Quick & dirty automatic differentiation

## Requirements
- Ocaml 5.x (tested, Ocaml 4 could work)
- Dune

## Compilation
`dune build` and then you should get an executable called `main.exe`

## Usage
`./main.exe ${SOURCE FILE}`

**NOTE:** The source file should have the extension `.exp`

And then you should get a file with a `.c` extension.
